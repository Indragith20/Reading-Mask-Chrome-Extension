# Reading Mask

## Description

Reading Mask is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your reading experience by creating a customizable focus area that follows your mouse cursor. By dimming the surrounding content, it helps reduce distractions and eye strain while reading online articles, documentation, or any web content.

### Key Features

- **Movable Focus Area**: A clear rectangular zone follows your cursor across the page
- **Customizable Size**: Adjust both the height and width of the focus area to suit your preferences
- **Adjustable Opacity**: Control how dark the mask appears for optimal contrast
- **Cross-page Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across websites, including those with iframes
- **Light/Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to your system theme preference
- **Simple Controls**: Easy-to-use interface with persistent settings
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Toggle the mask on/off quickly using Alt+M

Perfect for readers who struggle with focus, those who read lengthy content, or anyone looking to reduce eye strain during extended reading sessions.

## Usage

The Reading Mask follows your mouse cursor automatically, highlighting only the text you're currently reading. To customize your experience:

1. Click the Reading Mask icon in your browser toolbar
2. Toggle the mask on/off
3. Adjust height, width, and opacity percentages to your preference
4. Click "Apply Changes" to save your settings

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Windows/Linux**: 
  - `Alt + M` to toggle the Reading Mask on/off
  - `Alt + N` to freeze/unfreeze the mask position
- **macOS**: 
  - `Option + Shift + M` to toggle the Reading Mask on/off
  - `Option + Shift + N` to freeze/unfreeze the mask position

The freeze feature allows you to lock the mask in place while you move your cursor to interact with other elements on the page. Press the freeze shortcut again to resume cursor tracking.

**Freeze Feature**: When you press the freeze shortcut, the mask will stay in its current position and won't follow your cursor. This allows you to move your cursor freely to click on links, buttons, or interact with the page while keeping the reading area highlighted. Press the freeze shortcut again to resume cursor following.
